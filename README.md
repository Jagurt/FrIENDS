 My "Munchkin" inspired, first, multiplayer game.

## Munchkin
 Munchkin is a non collectible card game in fantasy RPG setting. It is a parody of an RPG session player type that cares about winning more then having fun. 
 Players have their characters and compete with each other to gain highest level the fastest way possible. Thanks to games volatile
