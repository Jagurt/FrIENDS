 My "Munchkin" inspired, first, multiplayer game.

## Munchkin
 Munchkin is a non collectible card game in fantasy RPG setting. It is a parody of an RPG session player type that cares about winning more then having fun, also called "munchkin". 
 Players have their characters and compete with each other to gain highest level the fastest way possible. Thanks to games volatile rules, becouse most of them are on cards rather then in the manual, the game is often surprising and makes it hard to tell who dominates until the very end of the game. Moreover all cards are presented in a silly and funny manner and contain a lot of popculture references.
 
 Me and my friends often played this game on meetups and convention but we have less time now, so I got an idea to make video game based on Munchkin to play remotely.
